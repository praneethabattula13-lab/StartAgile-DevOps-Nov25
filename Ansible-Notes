Agenda:
=====================================
Introduction of Configuration Management
Discuss on Different CM tools
Push and Pull Approach
Introduction to Ansible
Ansible Architecture and its components
Setup Ansible Controller and worker nodes.
=========================================
Configuration
=========================================
make changes on multiple server
    -> installing packages 
    -> copying config files
    -> creating files and directories
    -> creation users and groups
    -> setting up permissions
    -> deploying applications
    -> execution of script

If we have to these changes/tasks on 200 servers manually:
    -> Time consuming 
    -> repetitive
    -> error prone
    -> application  may crash
    -> all updates may not be available
    -> keeping a track of changes will be difficult
    -> Activities should done separately for different OS

Configuration Management:
================================
> Using an automation tool to make changes on several servers in different environments in very less time .
> It is all about bringing consistency across on the servers-> this can be achieved by using an automation tool.
> An automation tool will also ensure your desired changes are always available on the servers
>If our desired configurations are not available on the servers then the tool should identify that and make change son the servers
to get desired setup.
> We write code in order to make configurations changes using the tools
> This code can be maintained in VC tool and can collaborated with other team members.
> CM tool connect to the available infra and then make changes on them
> It creates a Logs of change performed in servers.

Infrastructure as a code tool: Terraform
======================================
Writing the code to create/modify/delete infrastructure on the cloud (AWS, azure, GCP)
Using a tool to write the code and provision the infra is called as IAC tool 


Various CM tools:
==================================

PULL Approach
==============
-> puppet
-> Chef

PUSH Approach
================
-> Ansible
-> Salt stack

Pull aproach:
==================

> chef
> puppet

In the pull approach changes are pulled by the agent nodes 
The controller or the master node will not make any changes on the agent nodes
The agent nodes have a agent process installed on them
these agent process will poll the controller on the scheduled time for changes
if there are new changes computed on the master node, the agent process will pull the changes and execute on themselves.



Push approach:
=================

> saltstack
>Ansible

The code is written in the master/Controller node
These tools can connect to the agent/host nodes parallely 
These tools will then apply configuration code changes immediatly on the host/agent servers
On the host/agent servers no agent process is present
Everything is controlled by master node

===================================
Ansible:
====================================
-> It is an open source tool and use it for free
-> It is very simple tool and easy to learn 
-> It works on push approach.
-> Ansible as a tool has 2 parts:
 1. Ansible core -> Ansible to be used on the command line 
 2. Ansible tower/AWX -> It is the GUI of ansible or Ansible dashboard
 -> Ansible will always be installed on a Linux OS
 -> Ansible can connect to servers of any OS -> Linux or windows
 -> Ansible is a python based tool which required version >=2.7
 -> Ansible configuration code is written in YAML
 -> It is an agentless tools
 -> It support configuring infrastructure on the cloud also.
 
 =====================================
 INVENTORY: WHERE TO DO THE CHANGES
 ==============================
 It is a simple file in which we will write the list of Ip address or hostnames of the servers where 
 ansible can connect and make changes.
 This file is available by default with a name "hosts" and is available at the directory "/etc/ansible"
 You can create your inventory file also and place it any directory of the Ansible controller.
 
 There are 2 types of inventory file:
 
 1. Static Inventory: 
 ============================
 Inventory file is created by user 
 Ip address are written by the user in the file
 When you have limited infra then create the static file.
 
 2. Dynamic Inventory:
 =============================
 If the number of servers are auto scaling that means they are on the cloud
 then we use ansible to generate our inventory file

====================================================
Modules:
--------------------------
They are nothing but python scripts (ansible pre-written code) that are pushed to host servers to make changes.
These modules accept some input parameters from the user to configure desired changes on the servers

example : copy module -> accept input like source file location and destination

get_url : url=https://example.com/file1 dest=/tmp

Ansible works by connecting to your host servers and pushing these scripts which we call as ansible modules 
on them.

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/modules/list_of_all_modules.html

We can create our own custom modules also in ansible using pyhton.

======================================================
Playbooks:
======================================================
Ansible code will be written in a file called as playbook 
A playbook consist of a play 
A play is nothing but:
  inventory hosts -> servers where to do changes 
  tasks to be performed
     -> modules to be executed
playbook is written in YAML

playbook with YAML code --> playbook is run on the ACM--> 
it is then converted to a python code --> this py code is copied on the worker server
ansible then executed the py program on each worker --> after the code is executed --> 
the python code is deleted from worker
In the playbook we can add -> variable, conditions, dependencies, handle errors, loops 

=========================================================
ansible.cfg file -> present in /etc/ansible 
=========================================================
All the configuration details of ansible are placed in this file.
user details, password details, module location, inventory location, fork details 
You can also create your own ansible.cfg with required parameters for the execution of the playbook
==========================================================
Create 2 EC2 servers:

Install Ansible on EC2 server:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

====================================================
CONNECT ANSIBLE CONTROLLER WITH ANSIBLE HOST:
====================================================
1. We will generate SSH keys on the controller machine 
Execute below command:
# ssh-keygen

Press enter key 3 times and keys will be generated 

2. Copy the ssh keys in the worker machine 
On the controller machine 
exeucte below command :

# cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
copy the key 

3. keys have to be copied on worker machine in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files

Go to worker machine 

# ls -al  ==> check if you have .ssh folder 

execute below command 

# echo "your-public-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

4. Validate Both the machine are able to communicate.

# ssh root@<privateip-worker>

you will see controller is connected to worker 

to come out of it execute below command 

# exit 

==============================
For us towrite ansible code, we go to default directory :

# cd /etc/ansible 

Update the host file with worker details 

# vim hosts 

press i

scroll to the bottom and create below host group 

[webserver]
<give-privateip-worker>

save the file and come out.

=====================================
Ansible code can be written in 2 ways :

1. Adhoc commands :
- single line commands 
- execute single module at a time 
- perform single change on the worker 
- whenever we want to quickly check something on worker we can use adhoc commands 

Syntax to write adhoc command:

# ansible <hostgorup> -m <modulename> -a "input argument"

demo:
# ansible webserver -m ping
# ansible webserver -m command -a "uptime"
# ansible webserver -m command -a "df -h"

2. Playbooks
=========================
Playbooks is used when we have to execute multiple tasks on the worker
Playbooks are written in YAML 
Playbooks is written in ACM only 
Playbooks consist of 2 main parts 
1. hosts -> host group created in hosts files
2. tasks -> modules to be executed

Structure:

- name: Give a name to the play 
  hosts: give the host group name 
  tasks:
  - name: give a unique name to your task 
    module-name: arg-name=value arg-name=value
  - name: give a unique name to your task 
    module-name: arg-name=value arg-name=value
  - name: give a unique name to your task 
    module-name: arg-name=value arg-name=value
  - name: execute a command 
    command: uptime 
  - name: install package 
    apt: name=php state=present

==================================
Register: it is a concept in ansible that will create a variable 
the variable will store/register the output of the module executed 
Playbook1 

# vim playbook1.yml 

- name: First playbook in ansible
  hosts: webserver
  tasks:
  - name: Print a greeting for the user
    debug: msg="Hello from Ansible Controller"
  - name: Execute a command
    command: hostname -s
    register: output_cmd
  - name: Print the variable
    debug: var=output_cmd

save the file 

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --syntax-check 

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml
